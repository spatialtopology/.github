## Navigating the Repository
* `task-{repo}`: The six fMRI task codes used on our "Stimulus PC".
  * Explore READMEs for task insights.
  * Utilize our code and cite us!
* `d_beh`: Contains scan-related behavioral data in BIDS format, pushed directly from "Stimulus PC".
* `spacetop-prep`: Preprocessing scripts for behavioral and fMRI data.
   * Installable as a standalone Python package.
   * Contribute your preprocessing or quality control tools via pull requests.

## Hi there üëã

Welcome to the spacetop project: A multimodal fMRI dataset unifying naturalistic processes with a rich array of experimental tasks.
### How to Navigate the repository structure
* `task-repo`: Each fMRI task is coded as a standalone repository. These code were operated on our "Stimulus PC".
    *  Check out each README to get an idea of the task structure.
    *  Feel free to use our code for future experiments. Remember to cite!

* `spacetopprep`: Alongside, we host scripts that were part of preprocessing the data, whether it was behavioral processing, redcap organization, or fMRI preprocessing related code.
    * Spacetopprep was designed to be a standalone python package. You should be able to install and import as a library. Check out the README for setup description. 
    * If you happend to develop preprocessing code or quality control tools, please do a pull request so that everyone else can utilize your amazing efforts!
